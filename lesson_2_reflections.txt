How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	- Camparing only code that was changed was easier to find bug.
	- You can see the difference in code and have picture of where your project is moving, how it is developed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives flexibilty to project. It's becomming easier to move back to your previous stages and try to fix code or even go different way.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs
