When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	First it's safe. If something hapennes with the computer data will be saved in GitHub server. Second, this way others can watch or even interact with the code (or whatever is stored on GitHub).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To keep project on hub completed and put only changes that are ready to be represented to the others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - when we copy someone's repository on GitHub to our repository on GitHub.
	Clone - copy from GitHub to our computer (or, rearly from one directory on computer to anotehr)
	Branch - creating a new branch in project, i.e. other version of project.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can compare and merge your changes with the latest code offline.
